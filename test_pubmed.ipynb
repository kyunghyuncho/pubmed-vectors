      "Abstract: Retarded post-prandial (pp) lipid clearance is potentially a major component of the increased cardiovascular risk incurred by hypertriglyceridaemic non-insulin-dependent diabetic mellitus (NIDDM) patients. The effect of bezafibrate (Bz, 400 mg per day for 5 weeks on chylomicron (CM) and remnant clearance after loads of 100 g of fat and vitamin A was therefore explored in 10 male patients (glycaemia 11.9 +/- 3.3 TG 4.5 +/- 2.4 mmol L(-1)). In all subjects CM-TG and retinyl palmitate (RP) were reduced by 50%, but 8-h non-CM (remnant) RP decreased only in initially mildly hypertriglyceridaemic subjects (-35%, P < 0.05), while in three patients with very elevated initial TG (epsilon3/3, epsilon3/2 and epsilon2/2 genotypes) 8-h remnant RP increased by 100%. The decrease in pp CM-TG correlated with that of fasting Sf 20-400 (r = 0.686, P = 0.026), suggesting that improved lipolysis was a major determinant of hypolipidaemic effect. Apo CIII synthesis is known to be depressed by Bz: concentrations were lower under Bz (P < 0.05). A positive correlation (r = 0.880, P < 0.001) with fasting TG before treatment and its disappearance after treatment suggested an involvement of high concentrations with hypertriglyceridaemia. Post-prandial non-esterified fatty acids were decreased by 35 in correlation with a significant (-19%, P < 0.05) improvement in fasting glycaemia (r = 0.801, P < 0.005). These results suggest that Bz acts both on lipolysis and on removal of CM remnants, but that removal can become saturated when lipolysis is massively improved.\n",

Thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them1), a BAT-enriched long chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase, is upregulated by cold and downregulated by warm ambient temperatures. Them1 (-/-) mice exhibit increased energy expenditure and resistance to diet-induced obesity and diabetes, but the mechanistic contribution of Them1 to the regulation of cold thermogenesis remains unknown.\n",

      "Abstract: Despite recent success there remains a high therapeutic need for the development of drugs targeting diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome. As part of our search for safe and effective MCH-R1 antagonists for the treatment of obesity, a series of 3,6-disubstituted pyridazines was evaluated. During optimization several issues of the initial lead structures had to be resolved, such as selectivity over related GPCRs, inhibition of the hERG channel as well as the potential to induce phospholipidosis. Utilizing property-based design, we could demonstrate that all parameters can significantly be improved by consequently increasing the polarity of the compounds. By this strategy, we succeeded in identifying potent and orally available MCH-R1 antagonists with good selectivity over M1 and 5-HT2A and an improved safety profile with respect to hERG inhibition and phospholipidosis. \n",
